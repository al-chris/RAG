    "A current amplifier takes an input current and outputs an amplified current, making it a crucial component in sensor interfaces, current-mode signal processing circuits, and driving capacitive loads. The common-source amplifier configuration is typically used, where the input current passes through the transistor's channel and the amplified output current flows through a load resistor connected to the drain terminal.\n",

    "A transresistance amplifier converts an input voltage signal into an output current signal, making it a vital component in photodetection circuits, electrochemical and biochemical sensors, and current-to-voltage converters. The transconductance amplifier configuration is commonly used, where the input voltage is applied to the gate terminal, causing a proportional current to flow through the transistor's channel. The output current is then obtained from the drain terminal.\n",
